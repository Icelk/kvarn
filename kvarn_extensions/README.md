# Kvarn Extensions

> Provides extensions that integrate with Kvarn

This is a library aiming to assist the main Kvarn lib with various extensions. It will provide a more feature-rich and full experience compared to the bare Kvarn.

# Current state
As Kvarn's extension system will soon be refactored, this crate is on ice for now. At the time of release v0.2.0, this should be up to date again.
