# Kvarn Chute

> A chute to transport .md files to be refined by Kvarn

This is a small binary designed to convert from CommonMark to HTML using the
[`kvarn_extensions`](../kvarn_extensions/README.md) template system.

It supports watching a directory for changes to .md files, or simply converting a single file on command.
